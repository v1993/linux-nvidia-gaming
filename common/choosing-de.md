## Choosing Desktop Environment

There are a lot of Linux Desktop Environments (later - DEs) in existance, which is probably a good thing. Sadly, not all of them are a good fit for purposes of gaming, even if they look pretty nice. In general, there is only one feature you really need for gaming: ability to disable compositor. There are some other ones, but they moslty fall beyond the scope of this article.

Note: stricly speaking, some desktops allow to use alternate compositor with them. If you use it, you're probably already qualified enough to evaluate resulting mix and can skip this article.

Below, there are some of popular DEs evaluated for gaming purposes:

### KDE - Great

Thanks to its higly tweakable nature, KDE is a good fit for gaming. It is also pretty rich in features, rather likely to satisfy whatever you want of your desktop. Compositing can be disabled either on per-application basis or easily via

It is used by author of this guide, so there is a separate section dedicated to configuring KDE.

#### LXDE - Great

LXDE is lightweigh and unlikely to interfere with whatever game you're playing. It also does not have compositor, meaning you don't have to disable one! It may not be a good fit for everyday desktop depending on your preferences, but may be worth a try as a second DE.

#### XFCE - Good

XFCE is also pretty lightweight, but unlike LXDE includes more features and compositor. Compositor can be switched off in settings, which is not really hand to do often. Once again, it might not be a good fit for everyday desktop, but is rather nice and feature-rich overall!

#### MATE - Good

MATE is pretty close to what I said about XFCE in all regards (I personally prefer XFCE of two, but it is mostly matter of taste). Compositor can also be swithed via settings or by making a script to automatically do so.

#### GNOME - Questionable

GNOME developers have decided to disable compositioning only for fullscreen windows, without option to do so manually. While this might work in some situations, it won't in other ones.

#### Cinnamon - Bad

There is no option to disable compositor in Cinnamon, making it a bad fit for gaming. But hey, it looks nice!
